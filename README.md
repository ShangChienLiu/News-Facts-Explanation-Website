## üìç Overview

The News-Facts-Explanation Website is a web application that offers users a platform to access news sentences along with detailed explanations. Users have the option to score these explanations or ask questions about them. A Large Language Model (LLM), like GPT-4, refines the explanations based on user feedback. This website aims to collect human feedback data to survey whether LLMs can generate better explanations when collaborating with humans.

| [requirements.txt](https://github.com/kennysuper007/News-Facts-Explanation-Website/blob/main/requirements.txt)       | This code snippet, located in the parent repository's `app.py` file, is the main entry point for the News-Facts-Explanation-Website. It utilizes dependencies such as Flask, Gunicorn, and ChatGPT to handle routes, user authentication, database queries, and generating AI-powered responses. The file structure is organized with templates for different web pages and other supporting scripts.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [download.py](https://github.com/kennysuper007/News-Facts-Explanation-Website/blob/main/download.py)                 | This code snippet connects to a MongoDB database, performs a query, and sorts the results. It then saves the query results as a JSON file. The code relies on environment variables for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [chatgpt.py](https://github.com/kennysuper007/News-Facts-Explanation-Website/blob/main/chatgpt.py)                   | The `get_response` function in the `chatgpt.py` file handles the logic for generating responses from the GPT-4 model based on user input. It connects to a MongoDB database to store chat logs and manages user authentication. The function takes in an incoming message, checks user authentication, and generates a response using the GPT-4 model. It then saves the assistant's response in the session data and returns it. If the user is an admin or if the session data exceeds a certain limit, the chat logs are saved in the database and the user is logged out. |
| [app.py](https://github.com/kennysuper007/News-Facts-Explanation-Website/blob/main/app.py)                           | This code snippet is part of a repository for a News Facts Explanation Website. The main role of this code is to handle user authentication and session management. It utilizes Flask, PyMongo, and other dependencies to provide login, signup, and session management functionalities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It serves as the entry point for the application and handles HTTP requests. It is part of a repository that follows a specific directory structure and has dependencies listed in the Procfile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [generatePasscode.py](https://github.com/kennysuper007/News-Facts-Explanation-Website/blob/main/generatePasscode.py) | This code snippet generates a JSON file containing 300 random alphanumeric passcodes with unique IDs. The passcodes are marked as unused. The generated file is used as a dependency in the codebase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
